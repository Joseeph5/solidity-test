# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

### Features

1. Validate students who passed the examen.
2. Check if student has passed the examen.
3. Get a list of all passed students.

### Built using

For the last few months I have been learning and working on Solidity, so this is what I am using to build this app.

- **Solidity**: Back-end(Smart Contracts)
- **HardHat**: Development environment
